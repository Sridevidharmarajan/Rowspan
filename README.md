Table Structure (<table>):
The <table> element is used to structure the data into rows and columns.
It includes a header row (<tr>) with column headings (<th>) for S.No, Name, Year of Joining, Salary, and Company Name.
Table Data Rows (<tr>):
Each <tr> element represents a row of data for each employee.
<td> elements within each <tr> define the data cells containing specific details such as serial number, name, etc.
The data for the Company Name in the last column uses the rowspan attribute to span multiple rows and width attribute to set the width of the cell.
Alignment and Centering:
The entire content inside <body> is centered using the <center> tag, though it's deprecated in modern HTML in favor of CSS for alignment.
Individual data cells (<td>) for numerical and text data are aligned center using the align="center" attribute.
